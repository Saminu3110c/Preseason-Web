# Welcome to My Css Is Easy I
***

## Task
The problem is was create a responsive page by using CSS FlexBox and media queries for both Desktop and Mobile views.

## Description
Before I start coding the solution, I first played the game "Flexbox Froggy" to refresh my knowledge on CSS FlexBox. I visited w3school.com also and I found it helpful.

## Installation
I did not install it. It does not need any Installation again.

## Usage
I works normally as it was designed to. And it's really amazing!.
