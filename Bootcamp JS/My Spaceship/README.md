# Welcome to My Spaceship
***

## Task
The problem is, you have been recently been hired by SpacePro, a new rocket manufacturer, and have been tasked with designing a simulator for their spaceships. This simulator creates a virtual “space” and keeps track of the basic movements and direction of a given ship. Your job is to keep track of where the ship is and it’s orientation relative to its starting point.

## Description
After reading the problem, I searched online through different website and figured out how to code the problem.

## Installation
I did not install it and it does not need Installation I think.

## Usage
It works as required
