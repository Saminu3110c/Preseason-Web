# Welcome to My Moving Box Realtime

## Task
My Moving Box Realtime - Bootcamp.js

Complete an index.html file with the missing javascript code in order to move the "div" with the id my_box_realtime to the coordinates of bottom: 0 and right 0. Moving the box must be smooth. This means you will update the position slowly: You can only change the position (vertically and horizontally) by 1 point every 0.5 seconds.

When we load your html page, we should see the box moving diagonally through the screen and it should take 35 seconds to reach its destination.

You cannot change the value of the html. Moving the box needs to be done using javascript.

```
<html>
    <div
        id="my_box_realtime"
        style="background-color: red; position: absolute; right: 70; bottom: 70; min-width: 100px; min-height: 100px"
    ></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        // YOUR CODE
    </script>
</html>
```

## Description
I solved the problem using JavaScript to move the "div" with the id my_box_realtime to the coordinates of bottom: 0 and right 0. Moving the box will be smooth.
