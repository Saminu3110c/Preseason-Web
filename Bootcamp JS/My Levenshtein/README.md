# Description
Your job is to write an algorithm that calculates the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two words.

The Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number is simple: it's a value that represents how similar two given strings are.
It is found by comparing two strings and returning the difference between them. (For information, the Levenshtein number is a real concept but we've simplified it a bit for the purposes of this exercise.)
