# Welcome to My First Backend
***

## Task
The problem was to create a backend app with light web framework (javascript you will use express).

You don't need to create a database, just store the information hard coded inside your file.

## Description
I follow the videos attatched to the problem and I also consoled my friends in order to uderstand how the codes in the videos work.

## Installation
I did not install it and it does not need Installation to my understanding.

## Usage
It works the way it was designed to and it's really amazing!
